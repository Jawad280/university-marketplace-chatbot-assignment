## Marketplace Domain Knowledge

### User pain points in student marketplace
- Finding affordable options within a limited student budget
- Ensuring reliability and quality of products
- Access to short-term loans for items needed only temporarily (semester, event)
- Availability of notes and second-hand academic materials from seniors
- Ability to quickly sell items when moving out or clearing space

### Safety and Trust challenges specific to campus communities
- Ensuring safe and respectful transactions within the close-knit campus community
- Facilitating smooth, amicable handovers to avoid conflict
- Preventing sales of academic dishonesty-related items like plagiarized assignments, lab results, or exam answers

### Seasonal Patterns
- Finals season: spike in demand for textbooks, cheat sheets, and study notes
- University festivals and orientation camps: demand for event supplies such as markers, paints, cardboards, flags and so on
- Health emergencies (pandemics, haze): increased demand for PCR kits, N95 masks, gloves, sanitizers
- Summer: demand for cooling devices and refreshing foods
- Graduation: demand for loaning graduation gowns, formal wear, and shoe care items

### Integration needs with university systems
- Email Verification: Restrict registration to students by validating university-issued email addresses
- OAuth Integration: Use the existing university portal for seamless user authentication and access to verified student information
- Event Calendar Sync: Integrate with university event schedules to anticipate spikes in demand for related items
- Disciplinary Record Check (Optional): To flag users with previous policy violations if university cooperation permits
- Course Enrollment Data (Optional): Access course registration info to offer course-specific materials or notes
